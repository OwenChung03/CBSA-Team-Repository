# Develop sectoral indices to study ESG sentiment and ESG hotness across 12 industries in Hong Kong
## Abstract:
This report, as a part of our holistic research, aims to provide real estate companies with descriptions and estimates of ESG public perception and expectations. This involves sentiment analysis and materiality analysis. In the process, we have developed sectoral indices for comparison across industries. Our findings allow real estate companies to set a better tone for their ESG efforts and understand how stakeholders may react to various ESG actions.
